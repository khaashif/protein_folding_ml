"protacs.csv" - PROTAC warhead data from PROTAC-DB  (with less columns)
"prot.csv"    - PROTAC warhead data from PROTAQC-DB (with more columns)


*NEURAL NETWORK CODE:
"nn-excl-106.py" - neural network model excluding 106 shared proteins from training data
"nn-excl-106-4-5-folds.py" - as above including PROTAC 4/5 folds in training


*SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE CODE:
"svm-excl-106.py" - SVM model excluding 106 shared proteins from training data
"svm-excl-106-4-5-folds.py" - SVM model excluding 106 shared proteins from training data


*HUMAN PROTEOME CSV GENERATION CODE:
"nn-incl-106-human_proteome.py" - NN model INCLUDING 106 shared proteins in training
"nn-incl-106-4-5-folds-human_proteome.py" - NN model INCLUDING 106 shared proteins and PROTACs 4/5 folds in training

*PLOT RESULTS:
"diss_results_plot.py" - results stored and plot here, result sets are split into code blocks

Regenerate has been set to false for all scripts.

To run the code, if the user wishes to utilize the regenerate code block, then simply set the if statement as "regenerate=True" 
and input desired ratio.
